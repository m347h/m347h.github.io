          <p>
            Hi! I am May, currently a Computer Science student at the University
            of Waterloo.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the past summer, I was a Fullstack Developer at MVS tech., where
            I worked with backend tools and frontend components to make service
            management systems more interactive and profitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started programming back in 2019 with learning the basics of HTML5
            and CSS, and I have been working on projects ever since. In
            particular, I enjoy learning the aspects of graphics design and
            machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the things I like to do in my free time include making arts,
            going to the gym, traveling, learning French, and experimenting with
            machine learning and data.
          </p>

          <p>
            That being said, I would love to know more about you, feel free to
            shoot me a message and letâ€™s chat!
          </p>

          <a href="#contacts" className="btn">
            Contact me
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
